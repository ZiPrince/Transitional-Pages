In this project I created a smooth transition page, that slides down after navigating to a different page. I also used keyframes to animate my images by revealing, then hiding them using 2 functions. 
All animations were done in CSS keyframes! 
It was a fun project to practice some CSS and making my webpage look nice UI wise.
